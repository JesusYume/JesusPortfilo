Hello! My name is Jesus Castillo!

This is my portfilo website made to display several facts about myself, my education, and my projects.

You will be able to navigate through the website to see everything.

This is a solo project and improvement to my previous portfilo website.

This project uses html, css, and javascript. It has animations of images and sprite characters.

I did remove the pixel font to make it clearer for users to read as the pixelized font was a little bit tuff to read.
