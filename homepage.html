                Hello! I am a graduate of California State University of Fullerton. 
                I graduated with two bachelors of science, one for computer science and the other for physics. 
                The courses in computer science and physics helped me develop technical expertise, such as programming languages, data analysis, problem solving techniques, statistics, while also helping me to improve my foundation in critical thinking and analytical skills.
                Additonially, courses containing projects refined my ability to collaborate effectively in teams. Project based courses helped refined my skills in time management, project coordination, and meeting deadlines.

                This is a project my classmate and i were assigned to create as a final for our computational physics course.
                The project shows animations of general relativistic concepts such as time dilation, length contraction, and the doppler effect.
                Programming language used are html, css, and javascript. As a pair working on this project we created a plan on how to tackle this program.
                Throughout the months preparing for this project we set tasks for each other and set up dates to join a call to discuss what we accomplished.
                With each tasks completed and or improved on, we were able to complete our assignment before the due date.

            <div class="section-title">
                Time Dilation & Length Contraction
            </div>
            <div  class="project-info">
                Time dilation is a concept in Albert Einstein's theory of relativity.
                Time dilation explains that time moves differently for a different obervers in the same inertial frame.
                Essentially time wil move slower depending on the observer moving close to relativistic speed to another observer.
                Take the famous explanation, one observer is standing on a platform while the other is on a moving train. Both have synchronized clocks and let us assume the train is moving close to the speed of light 0.99c.
                The clock on the moving train will move slower compared to the clock on the platform. Meaning that time is not absolute and depends on the frame of reference.

                <br/>
                <br/>
                Now what is interesting with time dilation is that it can occur due to a presence of a gravitational field, meaning time passes slower in stronger gravitational fields.
                Let's say you have a twin. You are living on Earth while your twin lives on Mars. Due to Mars having a significantly weaker gravitational field compared to Earth, your twin will age slower compared to you.

                <br/>
                <br/>
                Length Contraction is another concept in Albert Einstein's theory of relativity. 
                Essentially, length contraction is when a moving objects length is determined to be shorter in a moving frame compared to its proper length in a rest frame.
                Think of it like this, a stationary observer is in a rocketship. A different observer is moving in rocketship going relativistic speed near the speed of light. 
                The stationary observer views the moving observer and notices the length of rocketship has shrunk due to relativistic speed the observer is moving in one direction.
                <br/>
                <br/>

                How to work the animation:
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <div class="image-explain">
                    <div class="select-frame">
                        <img src="project_images/select_frame.png" alt="select-image"/>
                        <p>
                            1. Select a frame of reference to act as your stationary frame. 
                            You may select me or my classmate Travis as your frame of reference.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="select-velocity">
                        <img src="project_images/select_speed.png" alt="select-speed" />
                        <p>
                            2. With your frame of reference selected, that selection will act as your stationary observer. You must select a relativistic velocity for the other observer. 
                            What i recommend is 0.75 for the velocity. You can not enter 1 or -1 as that will mean the observer is travelling the speed of light which is impossible.
                            Lets not mess with the proper length and leave it at 100 meters.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <div class="image-explain">
                    <div class="result-image">
                        <img src="project_images/time_result.png" alt="result-image"  id="result-image"/>
                        <p>
                            3. Click play and pause whenever you want to. What do you notice?
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <br/>
                To the stationary observer viewing the observer moving in their rocketships, we notice two important results. 
                The time is different for both observers, the observer moving in the blue rocketship has a lower amount elapsed time compared to the stationary observer.
                Notice the length of the blue rocketship. It's length is much smaller compared to its original proper length.
                Confirming time dilation and length contraction.

                This is a addition to the previous project for time dialtion and length contraction. Originally, my partner and i focused only on time dilation and length contraction. 
                Until we realized that we could add another concept of generaly relativity. As our courses touched on the doppler effect. We decided to see if anyone has done this before and no one has.
                So, we decided to add the doppler effect to our project. We planned on how to tackle this by assigning tasks to each other. We were able to complete this before the due date.
                We decided to use a simple animation as both of us were new to animations in web design.

                We decided it will be best to represent the objects as circles colored yellow. Once the animation is played calculations are made for the moving away object and closer object. 
                You will notice one object will experience a blueshift while the other a redshift.

            The Doppler Effect
        </div>
        <div  class="project-info">
            The doppler effect is a phenomenon brought up by Albert Einstein's theory of relativity.
            It is defined as the increase or decrease in the frequency of a wave as the source and observer move towards or away from each other.
            When moving away an object will experience a "redshift". When moving closer an object will experence a "blueshift".
            A very interesting phenomenon. Where do we see this phenomenon?

            <br/>
            <br/>

            NASA has captured images of several galaxies. You will be able to see their are some galaxies more red colored or blue colored compared to the rest.

            <br/>
            <br/>

            All credit goes to NASA for this image:
            <img src="project_images/galaxies.webp" alt="galaxy-image" id="galaxy"/>

            <br/>
            <br/>

            Notice the galaxies that are more red in color, these galaxies are experiencing a redshift. The telescope is observing these galaxies far from our own. We all know that the universe is expanding.
            Some of these galaxies are moving away from the observer, hence the traveling light waves are becoming stretched out or larger in scale. Meaning the traveling light wave will be red in wavelength, hence a red shift when viewed by an observer.

            How to work the animation:

            The way my partner and i calculated this problem was by using the following equations.

            <br/>
            <br/>

            <div class="eqns-doppler">
                <div class="eqn-lorentz">

                    <p>Lorentz Factor</p>
                </div>
                <h3>And</h3>
                <div class="doppler-eqn">
                    <img src="project_images/Doppler-eqn.png" alt="doppler-eqn" />
                    <p>The Doppler Effect</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="code">
                Here is a snippet of our doppler function in doppler_effect.js named calcDoppler.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                <div class="code-explain">
                    <div>
                        <img src="project_images/doppler-code.png" alt="code" />
                        <p> We want you to imagine the circle as an object like a galaxy. We set the wavelength of that object to be the color yellow hence why you see 580 nm.
                            Note we are taking the reciprocal of our answer to help convert nanometers to rgba to hexadecimal.
                            Speed is our velocity of the object. We will say our velocity = % of speed of light (c). 
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Hence the equation β = v/c = %c/c (the c's cancel) -> β = % of c = speed/100.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Now we use the doppler effect equation where λ_source = λ of the color yellow = 580 nm.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            We then solve for the λ_observed (wavelength observered).
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Giving us a redshift for the object moving away from the observer and a blueshift for the object moving closer to an observer.

                Project #3: QuizzyPop!
            </div>
            <div class="project-explain">
                For my intro to front-end engineering course we were assigned to create a quiz app. 
                I was assigned to a group of 3. My classmates and i were given specific requriments and guidelines on how our quiz app should work.
                As a group we set up a concept/plan and with that created tasks. We held scrum meetings every week on a weekend. 
                During those meetinsg we discussed our progress on our assigned tasks.
                If one of us were behind we made sure to help.
                After completing a task, we would update the task to complete and move on to the next.
                Once all task were finished we look for any bugs remaining in our code. 
                When we were confident with our project, we submitted before the due date.

                <br/>
                <br/>
                QuizzyPop is a quiz application. The goal of Quizzypop is to allow users to select a subject to be quizzed on. 
                As of now the only subjects available for students are physics and astronomy. For fun we have fun facts and animal quizzes. 
                Once a quiz subject is selected, the user will be quizzed on that subject. Given 10 questions, each question will count as a point.
                At the end the user will be notified of their score.
